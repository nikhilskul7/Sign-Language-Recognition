# Sign Language Recognition Project ðŸ¤Ÿ

## Overview
Welcome to the Sign Language Recognition project! This repository contains the code and resources for developing a system that recognizes and interprets sign language gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Demo
Watch the demo video [here](https://github.com/nikhilskul7/Sign-Language-Recognition/blob/main/Presentation.mp4).

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Capture and store sign language gesture data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to recognize sign language gestures.
- **Inference**: Use trained models to interpret sign language in real-time.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python (>=3.6)
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning models for gesture recognition

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites before starting:
- Python (>=3.6)
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-recognition.git
   cd sign-language-recognition
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary configurations.

## Usage

### Data Collection
Collect sign language gesture data and store it in the `data` directory.

### Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the collected data using scripts provided in the `preprocessing` directory.

### Model Training
Train a recognition model using the preprocessed data with scripts in the `training` directory.

### Inference
Use the trained model for inference using scripts in the `inference` directory.
